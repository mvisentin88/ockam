# Accessibility

Accessibility describes an ability of the route (and workers in this route) to deliver messages to the destination.

It's related to reliability, but describes the principal ability to reach the destination rather then fraction of messages which reach the destination.


`Worker B` is **accessible from** `worker A` **via** route `A->B` when:
a message sent by `A` to `A->B` can be received by `B`

**TODO: PICTURE**

Workers `A` and `B` are **mutually accessible** if there are routes:
`A->B` **via** which `B` is **accessible from** `A`
`B->A` **via** which `A` is **accessible from** `B`

**TODO: PICTURE**

**Notation `A->B` in future implies that `B` is accessible by `A`**

In reverse, a route `A->B` **leads** from `A` to `B`

### Local routes

Local route is a route with a *single* local address, e.g. `[0#A]`

Because all workers define how messages are handled
and whether they are forwarded or not,
**routes with multiple local addresses are not local routes**

For example one local workers can send message to a remote node,
hence all the following addressed in the onward route after it will
be accessed in the context of this remote node.

As long as there is a worker with address `A` on the local node,
it's **always accessible** via local route `[0#A]` by **all local workers**

All node implementations should implement this behaviour.


### Forwarder workers

In order to make workers accessible, delivery can be routed
through additional workers

Such workers route all received messages based on some criteria

If we want `B` to be accessible by `A`

If there is a route `A->F` to a forwarding worker `F`
If there is a route `F->B`

Then `B` can be accessible by `A` via route `A->F` if
Worker `F` upon receiving a message sends a message to onward route `F->B`

**TODO: PICTURE**

There are many ways to decide the route `F->B` here

- It can be a part of the onward route, then `B` is accessible by `A` via `A->F ; F->B`
  Such routing worker is called **route based forwarder**

- If can be a part of the router worker state
  Such worker is called **static forwarder**

- It can be calculated from the message metadata
  Such worker is called **metadata forwarder**

**TODO: PICTURE**

**Forwarding is the main instrument for workers accessibility**


If `F` is a route-based forwarder,
and there is a route `A->F`
and there is a orute `F->B`

Then `B` is accessible by `A` via route `A->F ; F->B`

If `Fst` is a static forwarder routing to `Fst->B`,
and there is a route `A->Fst`

Then `B` is accessible by `A` via route `A->Fst`


Forwarder workers can be used to create pipeline routes,

For example if `F1` and `F2` are route-based forwarders

Then worker `B` is accessible by `A` via `A->F1 ; F1->F2 ; F2->B`

If `Fst1` is a static forwarder routing to `Fst1->Fr2`
and `Fr2` is a route-based forwarder

Then worker `B` is accessible by `A` via `A->Fst1 ; Fr2->B`

**TODO: PICTURE**

This combination of workers is called a **routing pipe**

From the perspective of `A`, routing pipe works the same as a single route-based forwarding worker,
which allows an abstraction to hide `Fst1->Fr2` communication

Pipes are used a lot in Ockam messaging, more on pipes in [Pipes and Channels](./Pipes_Channels.md)

## Mutual accessibility with return routes

Ockam Routing protocol allows workers to trace return route of the message.

Each time a message is sent by a worker, it may add a return route infomation,
if the worker is forwarding the message,
it may use the return route of the received message
and append some additional information to that.

Messages sent through a route `A->B` will have some return route when received by `B`, call it `trace(A->B)`

If return route `trace(A->B)` leads to `A`, then delivery on route `A->B` is **backtraceable**
Such route `trace(A->B) = B->A` is called a **backtrace** of `A->B`

If delivery on a route `A->B` is backtraceable,
then there is a route `B->A`, which is a backtrace of `A->B`,
hence  `A` and `B` are mutually accessible.

**TODO: PICTURE**

### Local route backtracing

Sice a local route `[0#A]` leads to `A` from any local worker,
then this route is a backtrace for any local route used to send messages from `A`

All local delivery is backtraceable

### Forwarding and backtracing

Backtracing is different for route-based, static and metadata based forwarders.

We will start with the route-based forwarders.

Let's say we want to send a message from `A` to `B` through forwarding worker `F`

`F` is accessible to `A` via a local route `[0#F]`
`F` is accessible to `B` via a local route `[0#F']` (`F` may be different from `F'`)

We have a backtraceable delivery `A->F` and backtraceable delivery `F'->B` with respective
backtrace routes `F->A` and `B->F'`

Then
if the forwarder `F` receives the message from `A` with return route `F->A`
it should forward the message with return route `[0#F'] ; F->A`

if the forwarder `F` receives the message from `B` with return route `F->B`
it should forward the message with return route `[0#F] ; F->B`

This makes worker `A` and `B` mutually accessible via routes `A->F ; F'->B` and backtrace `B->F' ; F->A`

**TODO: PICTURE**

Such forwarding worker is called **proxy worker**

Delivery through a proxy worker is backtraceable

By induction, delivey through multiple proxy workers is also backtraceable


#### Backtracing with other types of forwarders

Static forwarders forward to a specific route and usually cannot trace return routes to themself.

As a general rule, delivery through static forwarders and pipes is not backtraceable,
but additional forwarding workers can be used to manipulate routes and build backtraceable delivery
over multiple static forwarders.

More on that in [Pipes and channels](./Pipes_Channels.md)


Metadata forwarders may trace routes, but it depends on the specific implementation.
